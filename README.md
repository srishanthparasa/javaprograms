# MADLIBSGAME:
 
 
 I built a fun Mad Libs game in Java! ðŸŽ¯ As part of my learning journey in Java, I created a console-based game where you fill in words, and it generates a funny story.  ðŸ›  Tech Used: Java (Core), Scanner class for user input, String concatenation

 #SHOPPINGCART:
 
 
 This is a simple Java console program that simulates a shopping cart.  
It allows the user to input an item name, price per item, and quantity,  
and then calculates the total cost of the purchase.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Prompts the user to enter:
  - Item name
  - Price per item
  - Quantity
- Calculates the total cost.
- Displays a purchase summary.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 8 or above)
- `Scanner` class for user input

---

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works
1. The program asks the user:
   - **What would you like to buy?**
   - **What is the price for each?**
   - **How many do you want?**
2. It multiplies the price by the quantity to get the total.
3. The program then displays:
   - Quantity and item purchased.
   - Total cost in dollars (`$`).
